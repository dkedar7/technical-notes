# Bringing AI agents into your notebooks

[DeepAgent Lab](https://github.com/dkedar7/deepagent-lab) is a JupyterLab extension that integrates LangChain agents into your notebook workflow, enabling natural language interactions with your data science projects.

## Key Features

- **Sidebar chat interface** for conversing with your agent
- **Notebook manipulation tools** to create, edit, and execute Jupyter notebooks
- **Human-in-the-loop workflow** with review-and-approve before agent actions execute
- **Automatic workspace awareness** that shares file context with agents
- **Custom agent support** for langgraph-compatible agents
- **Zero-config setup** with automatic server detection

## Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install deepagent-lab
```

## Quick Start

The recommended approach uses the launcher command, which handles all configuration automatically:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
deepagent-lab
```

The launcher automatically:
- Detects available ports
- Generates authentication tokens
- Configures environment variables
- Starts JupyterLab

## Custom Agents

You can use your own langgraph-compatible agent by creating a Python file and setting the `DEEPAGENT_AGENT_SPEC` environment variable:

```bash
export DEEPAGENT_AGENT_SPEC=./my_agent.py:agent
deepagent-lab
```

The same agent configuration works across both DeepAgent Lab and deepagent-dash, making agents portable across platforms.

## Manual Configuration

If you prefer manual setup, configure these environment variables:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key
export DEEPAGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT=/path/to/workspace
export DEEPAGENT_JUPYTER_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8888
export DEEPAGENT_JUPYTER_TOKEN=your-token

jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token=$DEEPAGENT_JUPYTER_TOKEN
```

## Key Environment Variables

All configuration uses the `DEEPAGENT_` prefix:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Required for the default agent
- `DEEPAGENT_AGENT_SPEC`: Path to custom agent (format: `file.py:agent`)
- `DEEPAGENT_WORKSPACE_ROOT`: Working directory for the agent
- `DEEPAGENT_JUPYTER_SERVER_URL`: JupyterLab server URL (auto-detected with launcher)
- `DEEPAGENT_JUPYTER_TOKEN`: Authentication token (auto-generated with launcher)
